### Adding a traduction

Thanks for your interest in this project! Here are the instructions on how to add a traduction:

- Fork the repository
- Create a new folder under `_locales` named with the locale of your choice ([See supported locales](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/i18n/#supported-locales))
- Copy the english [messages.json](https://github.com/ghrlt/statiflix/blob/master/_locales/en/messages.json) file, and paste it in your folder
- Modify *all* of the `messages` key values
    Example:
    ```json
    "shareResults": {
        "message": "Share your results!"
    }
    ```
    this shall became this in the event of a French traduction
    
    ```json
    "shareResults": {
        "message": "Partagez vos r√©sultats !"
    }
    ```
- Once you're done, commit your local changes and make a pull request!
    - I will check and push whenenver I can! Thanks <3
